# Augemented Reality-Magazine-App

This application is cross platform app so, it runs on both ios and android.

Based on the target audience we have Students (i.e. students from year 1-3). Therefore, we have come up with an idea of making a magazine which consists of alphabets from letters A-Z, a-z and images of animals, fruits or plants. So, here in the magazine, each page consists of a single alphabet both capital and small and when the alphabet is recognised by the smart phone, the 3D model is produced which can be either an animal or plants with some description about it.

# Augemented Reality Application for mobile phones using Unity, C# and Vuforia.
